# Google Sheet

## Set up

1. From your google account, go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/home)
2. Create a new file of type Google Sheets

## Creating a sheet for clean data tracking

1. In a blank tab, insert a blank table
2. In the top corner of the sheet click at the left of column A to select all cells (Or Ctrl+A / CMD + A)
3. Set the Text wrapping to be "wrap". This will make long text easier to read in my opinion
4. Start naming your columns and set their type so dates and numbers will be formated the same for all the column's data

### Tips

* When a column needs to have a formula to calculate its values. Enter the formula in the first row of the table and extend it to all the cells
