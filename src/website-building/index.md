# Website building

## Types of websites

### Static
Think of it as a restaurant website displaying only their menu. Everything is pre-compiled and requested pages are returned to visitors. (Your local pizzeria)

### Web application
Image another restaurant, but with more budget. Their website has an authentication system for customers to connect, order food and earn fidelity points. (Dominos)

This kind of website needs computers running 24/7 in order to processed orders and customers activity to display the latest data to visitors and process online orders and send them to the right restaurants.

There is a lot more complexity to these websites such as the following different parts:

* Frontend: The logic that will display what we see on the screen
* Backend: The logic that will send the data to display to the frontend
* Database: The storage system where data is stored and updated in real time
* Proxy: A service that will merge the frontend and backend service together behind the same domain name
